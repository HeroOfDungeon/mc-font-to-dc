# Minecraft Font to Discord Theme
A small side project, the theme simply changes the default Discord font to the Minecraft font.
I'm currently working on making the symbols more pixelated, coming in the future
<br>[Thanks to Zane DragonBorn for inspiration](https://github.com/ZaneDragonBorn/Minecraftia-BD-Theme)
